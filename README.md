# FceRI_mast_cell_progenitors_in_blood

Mast cell accumulation is a hallmark of a number of diseases including allergic asthma and systemic mastocytosis. IgE-mediated crosslinking of the FceRI receptors causes mast cell activation and contributes to disease pathogenesis. The mast cell lineage is one of the least studied among the hematopoietic cell lineages and there are still controversies about whether FceRI expression appears during the mast progenitor stage or during terminal mast cell maturation. Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics analysis to reveal that fetal mast cells failed to produce all three FceRI subunit genes. By contrast, we found a temporal association between the appearance of FceRI
and the mast cell gene signature in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors in adult peripheral blood. In
agreement with these data, the FceRI+ hematopoietic progenitors in peripheral blood formed morphologically, phenotypically and functionally mature mast cells in long-term culture assays. Single-cell transcriptomics analysis further revealed the expression patterns of prospective cytokine receptors regulating mast cell progenitor development. Culture assays showed that IL-3 and IL-5 promoted disparate effects on progenitor cell proliferation and survival, respectively, whereas IL-33 caused robust FceRI downregulation. Taken together, we have highlighted differences between mast cell differentiation in various tissues and revealed upregulation of FceRI expression at the progenitor stage of mast cell differentiation in peripheral blood. We also demonstrated that external stimuli regulate the FceRI expression of mast cell progenitors, providing a possible explanation for the variable FceRI expression levels during mast cell development.
