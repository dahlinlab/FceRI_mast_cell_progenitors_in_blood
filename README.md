# FceRI_mast_cell_progenitors_in_blood

This repo contains information pertaining to the publication "Single-cell transcriptomics reveals the identity and regulators of human mast cell progenitors", (include link)

In this publication we explored the presence of the FceRI receptor during mast cell differentiation. Through the generation of 2 single-cell transcriptomic datasets we identified a population of FceRI positive mast cell progenitors, and identified cytokines that modulate these progenitors.

A conda environment .yml file is available under /init to reproduce the analysis environment.

2 .html files in /Processing describe the processing of the data available on GEO:GSE184351, for each respective dataset, to match the analysis described in the manuscript. Use the following links to see a rendered version of the files:
